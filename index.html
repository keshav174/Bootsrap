                        Elizabeth Holmes, the charismatic founder of
                        Theranos, and her ex-boyfriend Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, the group’s former chief
                        operating officer, will stand trial, charged with defrauding investors, doctors
                        and patients.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Somewhere among the court reporters will be investigative journalist John
                        Carreyrou, completing an assignment that started in February 2015 when he
                        received a tip about Ms Holmes, a Silicon Valley prodigy promising to shake up
                        healthcare with a revolutionary blood-testing system.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Last week, Mr Carreyrou won the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of
                        the Year Award for Bad Blood, his first book, which chronicles the rise and
                        fall of Theranos. Accepting the £30,000 prize at a dinner in London, he said he
                        had “put so much time and energy into [the story] that I can’t really picture
                        myself sitting at home seeing anybody else cover the trialHe is aware that one defence is
                        likely to be that the harm from any fraud was limited. This was simply a tale of a start-up
                        that failed, costing a few billionaires their investment, without enriching either Ms Holmes or
                        Mr Balwani, who have denied the charges..</p>

                    <h4 style="font-family: 'ABeeZee';" class="card-title">Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming</h4>
                    <p style="font-family:Alegreya Sans;" class="card-text"> I’ve been programming in Object Oriented
                        languages for decades. The first OO
                        language I used was C++ and then Smalltalk and finally .NET and Java.

                        I was gung-ho to leverage the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation, and
                        Polymorphism. The Three Pillars of the Paradigm.

                        I was eager to gain the promise of Reuse and leverage the wisdom gained by
                        those who came before me in this new and exciting landscape.

                        I couldn’t contain my excitement at the thought of mapping my real-world
                        objects into their Classes and expected the whole world to fall neatly into
                        place.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At first glance, Inheritance appears to be the biggest benefit of the Object
                        Oriented Paradigm. All the simplistic examples of shape hierarchies that are
                        paraded out as examples to the newly indoctrinated seem to make logical sense.

                        And Reuse is the word of the day. No… make that the year and perhaps evermore.

                        I swallowed this whole and rushed out into the world with my newfound insight.
                        Banana Monkey Jungle Problem
                        With religion in my heart and problems to solve, I started building Class
                        Hierarchies and writing code. And all was right with the world.

                        I’ll never forget that day when I was ready to cash in on the promise of Reuse
                        by inheriting from an existing class. This was the moment I had been waiting
                        for.</p>

                        Indoor
                        Skydiving</h4>
                    <p style="font-family:Alegreya Sans;" class="card-text">I was never particularly curious to
                        experience the
                        sensation of falling out of an airplane. But in the summer of 2015, out of a
                        sense of obligation, I stood in front a vertical wind tunnel in Tukwila,
                        Washington.

                        At the time, I was working at Amazon as a marketing specialist, and our team
                        had signed up for a corporate group activity at iFLY, an indoor skydiving
                        facility. For roughly 60 seconds, iFLY simulates the sensation of free fall via
                        a system of fans circulating air through a plexiglass tube, known as a vertical
                        wind tunnel. For this, the company charges $45.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I fly is the largest company operating in the indoor skydiving industry. It
                        owns, franchises, or licenses 67 wind tunnels in 13 countries, with locations
                        in Australia, Britain, France, and the United Arab Emirates. <br>I FLY even has
                        facilities on select Royal Caribbean cruise ships. And while professionals
                        skydivers do use them for practice, 80 percent of the company’s business comes
                        from new participants: field trips, birthday parties, and team-building events
                        like my own.</p>
